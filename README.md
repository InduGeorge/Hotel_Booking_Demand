Hotel Booking Demand : Prediction of booking cancellation

The hotel demand stems from business travelers and leisure tourists who travel frequently. With information on the hotel bookings, the main objective of this project is to predict the probability of booking cancellation. 
The business questions we are trying to answer are: 
1) Would a customer cancel his/her booking? 
2) If yes, what are the driving factors of booking cancellations?
In addition to that, this report is a summary of a data analysis study completed for City and Resort hotels to assess customer retention, repeat customer behavior analysis, and assist Hotel Management in anticipating hotel reservations based on seasonality and room type preferences. Customers' meals and any additional specific demands.
